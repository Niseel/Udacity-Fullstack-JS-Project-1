In my project, I utilize three scripts:

1. `npm run dev`: This script is used to clean the code, build the application, and then start it.
2. `npm run test`: It's employed to clean the code, build the application, and run Jasmine to execute tests.
3. There's an endpoint that consistently returns a status code of 200: `/api/`

I've recently made some modifications to validate user input.

Thanks for review my project <3
